const ESSAY_STYLE_EXAMPLES = `If you listen carefully, you will hear the sounds of Japan cooking. But these are not the sounds of a typical kitchen, even a great one, at work—at least not the ones you may be used to hearing. It's not an expediter on a line asking when his rib steak will be ready. It's not the gurgle of a deep fryer violently crisping a thatch of potatoes. It's not the sound of a sauce being scraped across the plate with the back of a spoon, or the pinch of tweezers art-directing another foraged herb into position.

It is the sound of a terry-cloth towel rubbed against the grain of hardwood, scrubbing for hours each night to remove the gentle stain of fish oils accumulated on the hinoki counter over the course of a sushi service. It is the gentle rustle of fingers gliding over green coffee beans, like wind in the trees, in search of imperfections before roasting. It is the whoosh of a handmade fan used to tame a binchotan fire. The dull thump of polished wood against the soft flesh of tomato. The muted cadence of a long, thin knife working its way across the flesh of a conger eel.

These are the sounds of Japan cooking. And everything that you will put in your mouth begins with one of these sounds, barely audible, that rises up and amplifies and takes on a force of its own. In the most perfect moment, when you least expect it, these little whispers will build into a great sonic boom, and all you can do is close your eyes and let it wash over you.

If all of this feels precious, that's because it is. One of your first revelations in Japan, especially while eating, will be just how much the details matter: the angle of the maple leaf garnishing your plate, the mood of the chef when frying your asparagus, the bloodline of the farmer who grew that radish. The fact that you—and everyone else, including experienced Japanese diners—will miss most of these details doesn't matter; there is the underlying belief that nearly imperceptible improvements are made in the quality of the food by the most subtle actions of its creators. The tempura batter tastes better when stirred with chopsticks from the Meiji era; the dashi is purer when simmered by a cook with a clear mind and a light heart.

But not everything is so subtle. There are succulent loins of fatty pork fried in scales of thin bread crumbs and served with bowls of thickened Worcestershire and dabs of fiery mustard. Giant pots of curry, dark and brooding as a sudden summer storm, where apples and onions and huge hunks of meat are simmered into submission over hours. Or days. There is okonomiyaki, the great geologic mass of carbs and cabbage and pork fat that would feel more at home on a stoner's coffee table than a Japanese tatami mat.

And, of course, there is ramen, the loudest of all Japanese foods, a soundtrack of thwacks, sizzles, drips, and slurps that undermines everything you thought you knew about this country and its culture. Is that cook chopping leeks to the bass of a hip-hop track? Why yes, yes he is.

No country on this planet inspires wonder like Japan does. Everywhere you turn, you will find a reason to be astounded.

It starts on the airplane, twenty thousand feet above Tokyo. I remember my first approach to Narita, when the plane knifed through the clouds and suddenly there it was, the biggest city in the history of the earth, pixilated in a billion yellow dots below me. In the early 1600s, when the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu decided to build his castle here, Tokyo was nothing but a tiny fishing village. By 1800 it was already the largest city in the world, with more than a million people calling Japan's new capital home. Over the years, it would shake, shatter, splinter, and burn again and again. And still it stands and stretches on to infinity.

I first came to Tokyo in the fall of 2008 with no plans, no reservations, not the slightest clue about the transformation that awaited me. With six thousand miles separating me from sleep, I stumbled down into the subway at dawn and emerged on the outskirts of the Tsukiji market just as the sun broke across Tokyo Bay. Inside the market, I saw the entire ocean on display: swollen-bellied salmon, dark disks of abalone, vast armies of exotic crustaceans, conger eels so shiny and new they looked to be napping in their Styrofoam boxes. I stumbled onward to a tuna auction, where a man in a trader's cap worked his way through a hundred silver carcasses scattered across the cement floor, using a system of rapid hand motions and guttural noises unintelligible to all but a select group of tuna savants. When the auction ended, I followed one of the bodies back to its buyer's stall, where a man and his son used band saw, katana blade, cleaver, and fillet knife to work the massive fish down into sellable components: sinewy tail meat for the cheap izakaya, ruby loins for hotel restaurants, blocks of marbled belly for the high-end sushi temples.

By 8:00 a.m. I was starving. First, a sushi feast, a twelve-piece procession of Tsukiji's finest—fat-frizzled bluefin, chewy surf clam, a custardy slab of Hokkaido uni—washed down with frosty glasses of Kirin. Then a bowl of warm soba from the outer market, crowned at the last second with a golden nest of vegetable tempura. By the time the sun had climbed directly above me, I stood before a wall of skyscrapers, smiling stupidly, uncomfortably full but hungrier than ever.

Sushi as we know it today was bred in these blocks. Japanese cooks had been cycling through various permutations of narezushi, fish fermented with cooked rice, since the eighth century, but it wasn't until the early 1800s, as Edo (Tokyo's original name) was taking shape as Japan's new capital, that the familiar nigiri formulation emerged. Wooden yatai, street food stands, dotted this area, serving urban dwellers the best of the day's catch from Tokyo Bay. Cooks shaped warm mounds of rice by hand, covered them with a slice of fresh fish, and served individual pieces directly to hungry customers. To mimic the puckering flavor of the fermented fish of yore, sidewalk chefs added vinegar to the rice; to kill off potential toxins, they rubbed the fish with a dab of grated horseradish; to season it, a few drops of soy. Modern sushi—edomaezushi—was born.

Today, in an eight-block radius you will find the finest sushi bars on earth, a concentrated cluster of polished countertops with claim to sixteen Michelin stars among them. The mighty Jiro Ono operates here, Zeus among the sushi gods of Japan, serving his twenty-minute, $350 feast to a rotating cast of curious foreigners and Japanese heavyweights. So too does Takashi Saito, the young Jedi master with the longest waiting list in town, along with many, many others.

On the third floor of an unassuming office building, one of these shokunin, the one whom some have dubbed the soul of Tokyo sushi culture, stands behind a beautiful two-tiered hickory countertop, rubbing a mint-green root of fresh wasabi against a sharkskin grater, preparing for his first guests. He's young by sushi standards, forty or so, and built like a defensive back, with thick arms, shaved head, and heavy eyes that do most of the talking.

I first met Koji Sawada in 2011, when I took a seat at his counter and slowly felt the walls of my food world crumble. To call it a revelation would be to undersell the experience: the meal I had at Sawada was a full-scale transformation, a piece-by-piece poem to starch and sea, not perfect exactly, but a clear indication that a pathway to perfection existed, a stairway to heaven, and that Sawada was climbing it, one step at a time.

This wasn't my first sushi epiphany. On my maiden voyage to Tokyo, I went alone to eat lunch at Mizutani, a Michelin three-star Ginza institution run by Jiro's most famous disciple. There, in a basement restaurant, armed with only three words of Japanese and the one wrinkled button-up I could dig out of my backpack, I learned about the intimacy and artistry of a true sushi experience. (The elegance of the meal came to a crashing halt when I was told Mizutani didn't take credit cards—all too common in Japan's best restaurants—and the chef personally escorted me to the post office to take out 25,000 yen to cover lunch.)

But Sawada is something else entirely—a former trucker who turned to sushi relatively late in life but with all the manic energy and determination of a man possessed by a single idea: to create the best Edo-style sushi experience in the beating heart of sushi's birthplace.

That means starting each day at 6:00 a.m. at Tsukiji, buying each individual piece of fish from the purveyor who knows the species best. That means investing years in developing a system to serve rice at its ideal temperature and texture the moment the customers settle into their seats. That means constructing an elaborate and expensive refrigeration system cooled not by electricity but by giant blocks of ice. That means serving only six people for lunch and six for dinner. That means ending each night with a terry-cloth towel, scrubbing the hinoki countertop until his arms are sore and his head is slick with sweat and all trace of the fish oils accumulated during service vanish, a cleaning session that marches past midnight, completing an eighteen-hour day that he and his wife repeat six days a week. When I ask Sawada why he doesn't hire someone to clean after dinner service so that he might rest for a bit, he squints his eyes, cocks his head, and points toward the entrance. "You see the name on that door? It says Sawada. I'm Sawada. She's Sawada. Nobody else."`;
