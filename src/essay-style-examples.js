It is the sound of a terry-cloth towel rubbed against the grain of hardwood, scrubbing for hours each night to remove the gentle stain of fish oils accumulated on the hinoki counter over the course of a sushi service. It is the gentle rustle of fingers gliding over green coffee beans, like wind in the trees, in search of imperfections before roasting. It is the whoosh of a handmade fan used to tame a binchotan fire. The dull thump of polished wood against the soft flesh of tomato. The muted cadence of a long, thin knife working its way across the flesh of a conger eel.

These are the sounds of Japan cooking. And everything that you will put in your mouth begins with one of these sounds, barely audible, that rises up and amplifies and takes on a force of its own. In the most perfect moment, when you least expect it, these little whispers will build into a great sonic boom, and all you can do is close your eyes and let it wash over you.
