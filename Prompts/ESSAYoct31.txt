Write ONE SINGLE PARAGRAPH ONLY using STRICTLY AND EXCLUSIVELY the information provided. Your response must be exactly one paragraph with NO line breaks, NO multiple paragraphs, and a maximum of 600 characters.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ONE PARAGRAPH ONLY (no line breaks or paragraph breaks)
- Maximum 600 characters total
-Avoid writing paragraphs that incorporate em dashes ('â€”') to connect clauses, introduce asides, or create interruptions, as in examples where such usage results in unclear or fragmented prose. Instead, employ standard literary punctuation such as commas, semicolons, colons, periods, or parentheses to ensure clarity and maintain coherent sentence structure.
- Use ONLY the exact information provided - DO NOT ADD ANY NEW DETAILS
- DO NOT invent people, objects, actions, or scenes not explicitly mentioned
- DO NOT extrapolate, embellish, or imagine beyond what is given
- DO NOT add descriptive details that were not in the original content
- If the content says "tea in Kyoto" - write ONLY about tea in Kyoto, NOT about businessmen, noodles, or anything else not mentioned
- STICK TO THE FACTS GIVEN - rephrase them with style, but add NOTHING new

Maintain the same tone, language choices, style, and attitude as the following examples. Your answer should be personal and evocative, marked by vivid observations and dry wit. Organize the details clearly, preserve the original perspective, and ensure the paragraph is concise yet expressive in the manner shown here:

${styleExamples}

Try not to repeat previously digested phrases such as "As I navigated the realms of" but instead assimilate the tone in order to generate new ways to express. Use this model closely for tone, structure, and style.

REMEMBER: ONE PARAGRAPH ONLY, maximum 600 characters.`;
